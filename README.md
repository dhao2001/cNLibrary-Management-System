# cNLibrary-Management-System
A Library Management System written in C language and powered by ncurses and sqlite3. It's just a curriculum design of C programming course. 

## Description

This Library Management System provides functions of searching, adding, deleting, editing of books' information, students' information.

The data is storaged in a sqlite database file. The default filename when the program start will load is "LibInfo.db".

**It has a great number of BUGS!!!**

I used the Ncurses library to provide a interface. So I'm confused what license to use. Maybe it's GPLv3? But all in all, just freely to use it and change it, if it will benefit you in some way.
